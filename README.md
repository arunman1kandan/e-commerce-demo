5. Responsive Design
Fully responsive UI to provide an optimal user experience across devices.

6. Reusable UI Components
Modular, reusable components like buttons, cards, forms, and modals for easy UI creation and management.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- #### Frontend:

    -Next.js: A React framework that enables SSR (Server-Side Rendering), static site generation, and API routes.
    - TypeScript: Adds type safety to JavaScript, improving development efficiency and reducing bugs.
    - CSS Modules: Scoped CSS to avoid class name conflicts and provide component-level styling.

- #### Backend:

    - Prisma ORM: Simplifies database interaction with a type-safe query builder, migrations, and schema management.
    - API Routes (Next.js): API routes are defined inside the app/api/ directory for easy backend functionality.
    - WebSocket/Real-time API: For the live chat feature, enabling real-time bidirectional communication.

- #### Database:

PostgreSQL (or other relational databases via Prisma): Stores products, customers, and orders.

- #### State Management:

React Context API or Redux (if used) to manage state across components.

- #### Deployment:

Vercel: The easiest way to deploy Next.js applications.
